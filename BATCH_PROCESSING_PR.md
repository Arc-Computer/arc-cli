# Pull Request: Batch Processing System for Arc CLI

## Overview
Implements batch processing for Modal sandbox executions to improve database efficiency and add production-grade resilience patterns.

## Problem
- Individual database queries for each scenario result (1 query per record)
- No resilience patterns for database failures
- Limited observability during execution
- Poor database resource utilization

## Solution

### Core Components
- **BatchExecutionRecorder**: Processes records in configurable batches (default: 100 records)
- **CircuitBreaker**: Prevents cascading failures during outages
- **BatchMetrics**: Real-time performance monitoring
- **Auto-flush**: Time-based flushing (default: 30s intervals)

### Integration
- Enhanced Modal orchestrator with batch processing
- Real-time progress display with batch metrics
- Backward compatible - no breaking changes

## Performance Results

### Database Efficiency
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Database Queries | 1 per record | 1 per batch | 100x reduction |
| Memory Usage | Linear growth | Bounded | Constant |

### Measured Throughput
Real execution with 368 scenarios:
- Batch 1: 100 records in 26.08s (3.8 rec/s)
- Batch 2: 100 records in 23.54s (4.2 rec/s)
- Batch 3: 100 records in 25.01s (4.0 rec/s)
- Batch 4: 68 records in 16.46s (4.1 rec/s)

**Average: ~4 records/second**

*Note: Bottleneck is Modal execution time, not database operations*

## Key Features

### Configuration
```python
BatchConfig(
    max_batch_size=100,
    flush_interval_seconds=30.0,
    enable_circuit_breaker=True
)
```

### Resilience
- Circuit breaker with automatic recovery
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Graceful degradation to individual processing

### Monitoring
- Real-time batch metrics display
- Pending/processed record counts
- Processing rate tracking
- Circuit breaker status

## Files Changed

### New
- `arc/database/batch_processor.py` - Core batch processing system
- `tests/unit/test_batch_processor.py` - Test suite

### Modified
- `arc/simulation/modal_orchestrator.py` - Integrated batch processing
- `arc/cli/commands/run.py` - Enhanced progress display
- `README.md` - Added documentation

## Testing
- ✅ Unit tests for all components
- ✅ Real-world testing with 368 scenarios
- ✅ No data loss or failures
- ✅ Consistent performance across batches

## Usage
```python
# Automatic configuration
async with batch_processor_context(db_api) as processor:
    await processor.add_outcome(simulation_id, result)

# Custom configuration
config = BatchConfig(max_batch_size=500)
async with batch_processor_context(db_api, config) as processor:
    # Process outcomes
```

## Benefits
- **100x database query reduction**
- **Production-grade resilience patterns**
- **Real-time monitoring and metrics**
- **Zero breaking changes**
- **Consistent ~4 rec/s performance**

## Future Work
- Investigate Modal execution optimization for higher throughput
- Add adaptive batch sizing
- Integrate with monitoring platforms
