# **Arc Product Strategy (v2.2)**

### **1\. Purpose & Scope**

This document provides a shared blueprint for Arc-Eval. Our long-term vision is to build the industry's leading **continuous improvement platform for AI systems**. This strategy outlines our initial market entry, which focuses on establishing a "wedge" in **agent reliability**. It aligns our product vision, user journey, technical architecture, and key research areas for this initial platform, defining the Day-1 MVP and the subsequent phases required to build a data-driven, defensible product.

### **2\. Problem Statement**

Modern LLM agents are unreliable and expensive in production. Enterprises and advanced builders lack an easy way to:

* Quantify reliability before/after deployment.  
* Pinpoint failure modes across multi-tool agent chains.  
* Optimize cost vs. performance without deep MLOps expertise.

Consequently, teams over-provision LLM calls, ship brittle agents, and spend weeks debugging emergent errors.

Traditional approaches to AI reliability are fundamentally reactive—they wait for failures to occur in production, then scramble to understand and fix them. This works for the 99% who deploy simple, single-purpose AI applications. But the top 1% of AI applications—the ones handling critical business processes, multi-step workflows, and complex decision-making—cannot afford to discover capability gaps through customer failures.

Proactive Capability Assurance inverts this model. Instead of asking "what went wrong?", we ask "what should this AI system be capable of doing, and can we guarantee it?" This shift from debugging to assurance represents a fundamental change in how we approach AI reliability.

**Core Pain Points**

| \# | Pain Point | Why It Hurts Today |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **P1** | **Opaque Reliability** \- teams lack a precise, repeatable metric for agent robustness across tool-calling chains | Unexpected failures surface post-deployment, jeopardising SLAs and user trust |
| **P2** | **Reactive Debugging** \- monitoring dashboards tell what failed, not why | Engineers waste days trawling traces to isolate root causes |
| **P3** | **Cost Overruns** \- high-token LLM calls dominate cloud bills | Finance teams push back on uncertain ROI; builders throttle innovation to stay within budget |
| **P4** | **Evaluation Expertise Gap** \- sophisticated eval harnesses demand niche MLOps skills | Smaller teams can't staff dedicated evaluation engineers, so quality gates are skipped |
| **P5** | **Fragmented Tooling** \- tracing, evaluation, and optimisation live in separate silos | Context is lost between tools, leading to duplicated effort and inconsistent results |
| **P6** | **Compliance Anxiety** \- regulated industries need audit-ready evidence of AI safety | Lack of standardised reliability reporting stalls procurement and expansions |

Arc-Eval attacks P1-P4 directly in the Day-1 MVP and lays the foundation for P5-P6 via local-first architecture and auditable scoring.

### **3\. Product Vision & Strategy**

Our strategy is to build a systematic platform that enables developers to quantifiably improve the reliability and efficiency of AI agents. We will execute this in two distinct phases:

* **Phase 1: Initial Market Entry (The MVP Wedge):** Our initial product will focus on solving a high-value, underserved problem for a specific user persona. This "wedge" is a predictive simulation engine with actionable, code-level recommendations, delivered via a developer-first experience. Its purpose is to deliver immediate utility, acquire our initial user base, and begin collecting a unique set of reliability data.  
* **Phase 2: Long-Term Defensibility (The Platform Moat):** We will leverage the data from our initial wedge to build a defensible system. This involves developing compounding advantages through (a) a proprietary data asset on agent performance, (b) algorithmic improvements driven by that data, and (c) workflow integrations that create high switching costs for enterprise customers.

**Our Core Product Tenet**

*Every feature and technical decision must be evaluated against a primary question: Does this increase a user's confidence in our reliability score and improvement suggestions to the point where they will modify their production code based on our output?*

**Model Neutrality Principle**

*Arc-Eval provides neutral, task-optimized recommendations across all model providers. We optimize for reliability × 1/cost, not provider preference.*

### **4\. Target Personas & Jobs-to-Be-Done**

For the MVP, our product experience will be relentlessly focused on the **Applied ML Engineer** and **AI Product Engineer**. Subsequent enterprise features will be built upon the foundation of a product these core users find indispensable. We assume users are comfortable with CLI or copy-pasting config, but not deep ML evaluation experts.

| Persona | Key Job | Pain Today | Desired Outcome |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Applied ML / MLOps Engineer** | Ship reliable agents | Ad-hoc tests, opaque failures, cost overruns | Repeatable evaluation with measurable reliability score & cost savings |
| **AI Product Engineer / Tech-savvy PM** | Prototype & iterate fast | Unsure how to test, steep observability learning curve | Drop agent in, get ranked issues \+ one-click fixes |
| **Head of AI/Platform** | Mitigate risk & justify spend | Difficult to prove ROI; compliance friction | Audit-ready reliability reports and cost optimization lanes |

### **5\. System & User Workflow**

The Arc-Eval platform is designed as a continuous improvement loop. The following describes the end-to-end workflow:

1. **Agent Profile Ingestion:** The user provides their agent's configuration file (agent.yaml) via CLI or web UI. The system parses this into a framework-agnostic profile.  
2. **Simulation Execution:** The system executes the agent within a secure, isolated sandbox against a curriculum of synthetic test scenarios. The scenarios will test various behaviors, including both naive vector-based and more complex agentic retrieval patterns to identify a broader range of failure modes.  
3. **Automated Error Analysis:** Traces from the simulation are ingested by a Failure-Clustering Service. This service uses embeddings and heuristics to automatically group related failures (e.g., identifying a "tone mismatch" pattern across multiple traces), surfacing insights before a human needs to review individual logs.  
4. **Reliability Analysis & Recommendations:** The system generates a reliability report, including:  
   * A composite reliability score.  
   * The ranked clusters of identified failures.  
   * A set of recommended configuration "diffs" to optimize for cost, performance, or balance.  
   * For complex trajectory failures, a "minimal repro prompt" is automatically generated to help the user debug the simplest version of the error.  
5. **Iterative Improvement:** The user reviews the recommendations and can apply a suggested diff. The system logs this diff\_acceptance event, creating a crucial feedback signal. The user can then re-run the simulation to validate the improvement.

### **6\. MVP Feature Set (Launch Day-1)**

* **Agent Import:** JSON/YAML parsing for framework-agnostic profiles.  
* **Tracing Layer:** OpenTelemetry collector for agent chains.  
* **Configurable Simulation Engine:**  
  * Secure Docker sandbox (e.g., E2B or a self-hosted container).  
  * Hyper-parameters for configuration, including cost\_cap, time\_budget, domain\_presets, rigor\_slider, and chunk\_size for document-based agents.
  * **Multi-Model Testing:** Automatic testing across 9+ model providers (GPT, Claude, Llama, Gemini, etc.) to ensure neutral recommendations.  
* **Synthetic Scenario Bank:** A seed library of test cases that will be generated using a structured Dimension → Tuple → Prompt pipeline to ensure diversity and relevance.  
* **Reliability Scoring Engine:**  
  * Calculates a composite score based on an aggregation of weighted, binary (pass/fail) sub-tests. The system will avoid Likert scales in favor of clear, objective criteria.  
  * Employs a cost-control hierarchy, running cheap, rule-based assertions first and reserving more expensive LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations for persistent or subjective failures.  
* **Optimization & Analysis Tools:**  
  * **Failure-Cluster Viewer:** A view that presents auto-grouped failure patterns.  
  * **Minimal-Repro Generator:** A feature to create simplified test cases for failed multi-turn trajectories.  
  * **Optimization Recommendations:** Generates diffs for Cheapest vs. Highest-Perf vs. Balanced configurations.
  * **Cross-Model Recommendations:** Suggests optimal model selection based on task performance and cost, not provider preference (e.g., "Switch to claude-3-haiku for 96% reliability at 98.7% lower cost").  
* **Interface & API:**  
  * Primary interface will be a CLI with rich text and JSON output.  
  * Will include REST API endpoints (/export/traces, /import/labels) from day one to allow teams to build their own custom annotation UIs or plug into tools like Hex/Jupyter.

### **7\. Strategy for Long-Term Defensibility**

The MVP is designed to generate a unique data asset. The following strategic pillars describe how we will leverage this asset to build a defensible platform.

7.1 Proprietary Data Asset: The Configuration → Outcome Graph  
Our primary long-term advantage will be a proprietary dataset that maps agent configurations and test scenarios to performance outcomes.

* **Unique Signal:** Unlike competitors who primarily see production traces, our data will include (a) agent behavior in sandboxed, pre-production simulations and (b) the explicit diff\_acceptance signal from the user.  
* **Strategic Value:** This graph will enable us to develop predictive models about agent reliability that competitors cannot easily replicate. It becomes the training data for all subsequent algorithmic improvements.
* **Model-Neutral Advantage:** By capturing performance data across ALL providers (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.), we build a unique cross-model optimization capability that no single provider can offer.

7.2 Algorithmic Advantage: Dynamic Test Selection  
The Configuration→Outcome graph will power an active learning system to optimize our simulation process.

* **Mechanism:** A bandit-based model will be trained to select the most informative test scenario to run next for a given agent, maximizing insight per unit of compute cost.  
* **Strategic Value:** This creates a more efficient and effective evaluation process over time, delivering better results for users at a lower cost and improving our core algorithmic IP.

7.3 Enterprise Adoption: Governance & Compliance Features  
To create high switching costs and support enterprise sales, the platform will generate auditable artifacts.

* **Key Artifacts:** For each simulation run, the system will produce:  
  1. A **Signed Reliability Attestation** (JSON format).  
  2. An **Agent Toolchain SBOM** (Software Bill of Materials).  
  3. A **Compliance Mapping Workbook** (e.g., for SOC 2 controls).  
* **Strategic Value:** By integrating these artifacts into enterprise GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) workflows, Arc-Eval becomes a system of record, making it difficult to replace.

### **8\. Open Technical Questions & Research Items**

* **Simulation Sandbox:** E2B API vs. self-hosted Docker? Conduct spikes to evaluate latency, cost, security, and scalability trade-offs.  
* **Scenario Generation:** Implement and refine the Dimension → Tuple → Prompt pipeline. Define the initial domain taxonomies (e.g., finance, healthcare). Ensure scenarios test across multiple model providers from Day 1.  
* **Agent-as-a-Judge Quality:**  
  * **Initial Model:** Calibrate GPT-4.1-Mini as the default judge model.  
  * **Goal:** Achieve a high True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) (target ≥ 0.9) against a human-calibrated gold set.  
  * **Future Work:** Explore cheaper, distilled models for judging once baseline performance is established.  
* **Result Verifiability:** How to best expose the scoring rubric? Implement versioned storage of simulation runs to show reliability uplift over time.  
* **Optimization Diff Mechanism:** Spike on static templates vs. model-generated patches, including safety checks before auto-application.  
* **Data & Compliance:** Define local storage format (e.g., SQLite/Parquet). Begin SOC 2 readiness planning and implement PII redaction in traces.

### **9\. Design Partner Pilot Plan**

To ensure our product provides tangible value and to calibrate our evaluation models, our pilot program will be structured around close collaboration with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).

* **SME Gate:** Each design partner will designate one primary SME (the "benevolent dictator") who will be the definitive voice on domain-specific quality.  
* **Feedback Loop:** This SME's feedback on the relevance of identified failures and the quality of suggested diffs will be used as the "gold standard" to calibrate our Agent-as-a-Judge models and refine our scenario bank.

### **10\. Key Risks & Mitigations**

* **Agent-as-a-Judge Quality:**  
  * *Risk:* Scores mis-align with human judgment.  
  * *Mitigation:* Calibrate against the pilot SME's feedback; use ensemble methods; maintain a human spot-check loop.  
* **Sandbox Cost Overruns:**  
  * *Risk:* High compute/inference costs.  
  * *Mitigation:* Implement strict cost-cap hyper-parameters; enforce the rule-first evaluation hierarchy; provide a local-only execution option.  
* **Feature Creep vs. MVP Focus:**  
  * *Risk:* Expanding scope delays launch.  
  * *Mitigation:* Adhere to the tightly-scoped MVP feature set; weekly scope reviews; defer non-essential features until after Developer Preview.  
* **Compliance Blockers:**  
  * *Risk:* Regulated industries cannot adopt.  
  * *Mitigation:* Prioritize the local-first "Edge" deployment option; begin SOC 2 documentation and process planning in parallel with the Beta phase.
